Used OS: Linux - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Ok, letâ€™s get started.

*Best practice for using some tool - is to create virtual environment for avoiding conflict between your already installed  python packages and  packages used in utility.*

### 1. Commands for installing virtual environment:

 `sudo apt-get install python-pip` - If pip is not in your system:

`pip install virtualenv`  - install virtualenv

`virtualenv virtualenv_name` - create a virtual environment now.

`source virtualenv_name/bin/activate` - to activate it.

### 2. Then, git clone repository  from github and cd to that:

### 3.  command for downoload all packages sufficient for tool usage.

 pip `install` -r requirements.txt 

### 4. Launch the script pain.py

python3 [pain.py](http://pain.py)
